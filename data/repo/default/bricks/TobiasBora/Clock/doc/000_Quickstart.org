* What is this Clock brick ?
This minimalist brick display a simple clock like that :
  HH:MN:SS
on your page that refresh every seconds.

* How can I add it in the page ?
First edit in your brick the file $B/package/bricks_included.txt and add
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
TobiasBora/Clock
#+END_SRC

Then, in your .eliom file call the function
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let clock = TobiasBoraClock.full_classic_clock () in
#+END_SRC
and you can insert "clock" anywhere in your page, like a classic div entry.

* I would like to define a style for this clock
The clock is inserted into a div whose class is =TobiasBoraClock_div=.

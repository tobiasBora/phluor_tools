* What is Phluor ?
Phluor is a project which wants to make easier the creation of a website based on different modules ("bricks") working together.

** The philosophy
Phluor is mainly based on these bricks. The idea is to have a modular system: a brick must be easy to create, each brick can use others bricks or Ocaml modules as dependancies to work. A brick must be really easy to install: copying the brick in the =src/= folder should be enough.

Moreover I'm sure that the documentation is one of the main points of a project, so each brick should have a good documentation and should be easy to use.

* How can I create a new website ?
Install phluor_tools, go in the root directory and run:
: phluor_tools create_website

(Note that you can type only some letters until there is only one possibility. For example 'create_w' (or even 'cre' for the moment) should work. I may add later some shorcuts such as 'cw' for 'create_website'.

You'll be asked to answer to several questions, depending on the template you want to use, the website will be created in a new folder whose name is the name of the project (you can change it if you want without any problem). Please give a name which isn't existing, if so the two websites will be mixed. I will solve this issue later.

* How is Phluor organised ?
Here are the main folders present by default:
- =doc/=: The documentation folder
- =config/=: This folder will contain the code of all your bricks
- =src/=: All bricks should be in the =src/= folder.
- =static/=: The =static/= folder should contain any file which must be accessible from the website but which isn't linked to a brick. For example put here CSS...

Some folder are created during the compilation:
- =www/=: This folder is autogenerated during the compilation (you can find a backup in the hidden folder =.www_bak/=): it contains all the files used by /ocsigenserver/. You can find here the autogenerate configuration file of /ocsigenserver/, all binary version of bricks, the final =static/= folder...

* How can I choose which bricks should be loaded in my website ?
You must put in the file =bricks_included.txt= all the bricks you want to load in the website. This name (often called =brick= or =brick_name=) must be such as the folder =src/$(brick_name)/= is the root folder of the brick.

For exemple if the brick is in:
: src/bob_the_coder/my_test_brick
and if you want to include it in the website, you must put in =bricks_included= bob_the_coder/my_test_brick

If the brick has some dependencies to other bricks, you don't need to put them in module_list, just put the main bricks, and let phluor do the magic !

* How can I build my website ?
To compile your website you need to run, if you want to compile the code and run the server run:
: make r

That's it ! You website should be available in somewhere like http://localhost:8080/

You can run too the following commands.

If you just want to compile the code:
: make

If you just want to run the website:
: make run

If you want to clean only the files generated for the server configuration please run:
: make clean

And if you want to clean every bricks:
: make clean_all

And don't forget, when you do =make clean= a backup of =www/= is created in the hidden folder =.www_bak/= !

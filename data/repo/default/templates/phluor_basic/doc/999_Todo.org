* TODO List
** Easy and fast
- Automatise documentation generation from sources
- Re-charge the configuration in config/ of a brick in src/
- Add a way to remove a library

** Easy and long
- Document everything

** May be hard/long to do
- Create the database at startup
- Deal with a local database
- Auto-generate config/<...>/modules.xml

** No sure it's possible to correct
- Correctly deal with .mli when a .mli is removed (I don't want to do make clean each time I remove a .mli ==> It doesn't work only after a mv of the eliomi file ==> Nothing to do with the Makefile ?)
